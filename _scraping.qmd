# Getting data without an API - Web Scraping

Web scraping is the process of extracting information from a website, usually by parsing the html that is used by the web browser to display a page to the user.

This usually requires first manually inspecting the html in order to understand its structure, and how to access the parts you want.

## Caveats

Read the terms of service:
 - many websites explicitely forbid web scraping
 - some websites (e.g.: Wikipedia) have a code of conduct for scraping

Avoid placing undue strain on a website. Add reasonable delays between requests.

Be aware that you may get your IP blocked for unusual activity.

Web scraping code is often fragile, slight updates to a websites design will require maintainance of the code.

## Typical (research) uses

Retrieving tabular information.

Tracking changes in published information over time.

Comparing occurences of phrases, links or sentiments between groups of pages.

Building a map of links between pages (web spider/crawler)
