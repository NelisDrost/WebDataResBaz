# Data on the web - what/why/how?

There are two primary ways to retrive data from the internet:

:::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
***APIs***

Intended way to retrive data (or push it)

Often very efficient

Usually well documented

May require authentication (i.e.: sign up)

May have usage limits

Multiple types, REST being the most common
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
***Scraping***

Allows download of almost any data

May be against terms of use, may result in IP blocking

Less resource efficient than APIs

Likely to require maintainance
