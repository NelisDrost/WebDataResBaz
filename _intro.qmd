# Data on the web - what/why/how?

There are two primary ways to retrive data from the internet:

:::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
***APIs***

Intended way to retrive data (or push it)

Often very efficient

Usually well documented

May require authentication (i.e.: sign up)

May have usage limits

Multiple types, REST being the most common
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
***Scraping***

Allows download of almost any data

May be against terms of use, may result in IP blocking

Less resource efficient than APIs

Likely to require maintainance

## APIs
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are how applications on the web communicate - they allow users to submit and retrieve data using a predefined set of endpoints. 

APIs may be intended for private use, e.g.: the back end of an application, or public use: e.g.: dissemination of open data.

## Web Scraping
Web scraping is the process of extracting information from a website, usually by parsing the html that is used by the web browser to display a page to the user.

A web crawler is a program that automatically follows links on a page to discover more content
